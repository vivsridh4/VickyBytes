## Open Source LLM for Coding!

GitHub Copilot is a valuable tool for coding assistance while developing software. Under the hood,
LLMs can power seamless developer experiences through inline code assistance, code fine-tuning,
conversational support in the IDE and much more. Most of these models are proprietary and can
only be used via subscription services. The good news is you can use several open-source LLMs for
coding. If youâ€™re in a space where you need to build your own coding assistance service (such as a
highly regulated industry), look at models like [StarCoder](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder) and [WizardCoder](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/blob/main/WizardCoder/README.md). StarCoder is trained with a
large data set maintained by BigCode, and Wizardcoder is an Evol-Instruct tuned StarCoder model.
