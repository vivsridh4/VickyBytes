## [DevOps for All!](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/eventseries/AzureHappyHours)

If you're wondering what does DevOps mean? And who is a DevOps Engineer? What skills do I need to be a successful DevOps / SRE engineer? What tools do I need to master to be a full-stack DevOps / SRE engineer, or how to bring DevOps culture & tools into your startup? Then this is the series to follow.  

Super excited to bring two-month program at Microsoft Reactor as part of my #AzureHappyHours show to start your career with confidence as a DevOps engineer with Kubernetes. By the end of this series, you will be confident to handle DevOps / SRE tasks at your job and in your startups. If confused, you can go back to on-demand learning resources to implement best practices. 

We will cover end-to-end DevOps workflow with Kubernetes.

### [17th September - A Recipe for DevOps Engineering & Beginners!](https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-bengaluru/events/280634341/)

I walked into a startup as a DevOps Lead where it was at zero DevOps maturity. Join me this **#AzureHappyHours**, where I will share my story about how we implemented DevOps in a startup from scratch, how we moved to 99.9% uptime, the challenges we faced, and what tools we adopted to scale DevOps. 

In this session, experience DevOps with a real-world example.
